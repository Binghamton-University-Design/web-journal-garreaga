	            <h3><a href="">DESIGN BRIEF: MYSTERY FLESH PIT NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>
	            <p>	Mystery Flesh Pit National Park is an alternate reality story/ experience by Trevor Roberts that documents the comprehensive history of a mysterious discovery in Texas that later turns into a national park with many secrets that eventually lead to its shutdown. Trevor started this passion project on the subreddit r/worldbuilding as a creative outlet. Since then, he has grown the amount of documents/illustrations included tenfold and puts out new content every month. </p>

	           <p> Here’s a quick quote from the FAQ page on the MFP Tumblr, describing what the mystery flesh pit is:</p>

	           <p>“The Mystery Flesh Pit is the name given to a bizarre natural geobiological feature discovered in the permian basin region of west texas in the early 1970s. The pit is characterized as an enormous subterranean organism of indeterminate size and origin embedded deep within the earth, displaying a vast array of highly unusual and often disturbing phenomena within its vast internal anatomy.

               Following its initial discovery and subsequent survey exploration missions, the surface orifice of the Mystery Flesh Pit was enlarged and internal sections were slowly reinforced and developed by the Anodyne corporation which opened the Pit as a tourist attraction in 1976. In the early 1980s, the site was absorbed into the National Park System which operated and maintained the Mystery Flesh Pit until its sudden closure in 2007.”
               </p>
               <p> This story has taken off on the internet since its conception about a year ago, however, they don’t have a website besides the blog where information is posted/ a subreddit/ a discord/ a patreon. Because of the nature of the project being ever expanding and having many pieces of lore that aren’t solidified yet, along with the emphasis for the audience to create their own analysis and interaction with the content, I think creating a digital experience centered around somebody that was once a visitor to Mystery Flesh Pit would be fruitful and engaging.
               The website will serve to be an interactive and creepy way to browse through the current MFP universe along with my own narrative of a park goer and their findings. I have directly contacted Trevor himself and he has given me his express permission to use all of the content he has created for this purpose. I’m really excited to get started on building the atmosphere and aesthetics and incorporating the story!
